## About Me

I am an undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at VIT Chennai. My interests lie in developing intelligent systems that solve real-world problems using AI, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. I am particularly inclined towards computer vision, spatio-temporal modeling, and ethical applications of AI.

I am currently working on research and projects that combine CNNs, GNNs, and time-series analysis to derive meaningful insights from satellite imagery and unstructured data. I value clean code, reproducible research, and practical impact.

## Projects

**Glacier Melt Prediction using CNN + Spatio-Temporal GNN**  
Developed a deep learning pipeline combining ResNet50 and GraphSAGE to analyze satellite-based glacier imagery and predict melt patterns without ground truth melt data. Achieved 79% accuracy using pixel-level changes and graph-based temporal modeling.

**Library Management System**  
Designed a software tool for managing book inventories, student checkouts, and late returns using Java and MySQL. Includes admin login, book search, chatbot and borrowing history tracking with clean front-end forms and backend data handling

**Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm (Embedded Project, Ongoing)**  
Developing a robotic arm that responds to real-time hand gestures captured via sensors. The system uses microcontroller integration to translate gesture input into mechanical movement with future plans for wireless control and CV-based gesture recognition.
